Some of my better java based demonstrations of algorithms I was proud of writing
are included here. I also host most of the applets on my server, the following 
are descriptions and links to the contained applets.

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/detect.html Is an edge detection applet. It allows
you to dynamically manipulate the parameters sent to the edge detection. It's
a modified Canny based algorithm and provides pretty good results, though not
highly optimized

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/collider.html A particle collision demo that runs on
top of my kd-tree for fast collision detection. Allows you to adjust particle
parameters and contains two sets of particles.

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/collidergame.html A simple game. Use arrow keys to
avoid the smaller balls for as long as possible!

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/nnsearch.html Demonstrates the high efficiency of 
the kd-tree implementation by doing a nearest neighbor search on a large set of
points. Provides debug information and lets you adjust the number of points and
number to find.

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/rangesearch.html Similar to the nearest neighbor
search, the range search finds all points in a given radius using the kd-tree
for extremely high efficiency.

http://bland.no-ip.org/files/flocking.html Extremely interesting 3D simulation 
of flocking creatures using a kd-tree for nearest neighbor searches. Allows 
adjustment of flocking parameters, so play around with it!
